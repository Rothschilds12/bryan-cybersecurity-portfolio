/etc/passwd:
    This file contains a list of all user accounts on the system. Each line represents a user and includes fields like username, user ID (UID), group ID (GID)
    home directory, and the default shell. Importantly, it does not store passwords



/etc/shadow:
    This is the critical file that stores encrypted user passwords (hashes) and password expiration information. it's highly protected and typically
    only readable by the root user. If you can gain access to this file, you can attempt to crack the password hashes offline


/etc/group:
    This file lists all the groups on the system and the users who belong to each group. Understanding group memberships can reveal which users
    have access to specific resources or can execute certain commands
