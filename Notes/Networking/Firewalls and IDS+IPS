Firewalls operate at different levels:

Packet-Filtering Firewalls:
    These are the simplest, inspecting individuals network packets based on basic information like source/destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols.
    If a packet doesn't match an allowed rule, it's dropped

Stateful Firewalls:
    More sophisticated, these firewalls track the "state" of active network connections. They remember legitimate outgoing connections and automatically allow
    return traffic for those connections. This makes them much harder to bypass with simple, unsolicited incoming packets

Application-Layer Firewalls (Proxies):
    These operate at the application layer of the TCP/IP model, understanding the context of specific applications and protocols (like HTTP). The can inspect
    the content of traffic, not just the headers, offering deeper protection






Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): The Silent Alarms

    Signature-Based IDS:
        This is like an antivirus program. It has a database of known attack patterns (signatures) and flags traffic that matches them

    Anomaly-Based IDS:
        This type learns what "normal" network behavior looks like and flags anything that deviates significantly from that baseline

An IDS is passive; it detects and alerts, but it doesn't actively block the malicious traffic
