http (80)
https (443)

https adds encryption (SSL/TLS) for secure communication



ftp (File transfer protocol)
data (20)
control (21)

Often found with weak credentials (e.g., anonymous login) or vulnerable software versions allowing unauthorized file access or upload




ssh (Secure Shell)
(22)

Provides a secure channel over an unsecured network for remote-line access, file transfers, and tunneling
Good target for brute-force attacks against weak passwords, or exploiting vulnerable ssh server versions





smb (Server Message Block)
NetBIOS Session Service (139)
SMB over TCP (445)

Primarily used by windows systems for file sharing, printer sharing, and interprocess communication
Is a goldmine for enumeration (e.g., listing shares, users) and exploitation (e.g., EternalBlue, misconfigured permissions, weak credentials) It's crucial for Windows environments and Active directory attacks




dns (Domain Name Service)
TCP and UDP (53)

Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into machine-readable IP address
NDS can be a rich source of information during reconnaissance (e.g., zone transfers, subdomain enumeration). Misconfigurations can sometimes lead to cache poisoning or other vulnerabilities

A successful zone transfer reveals all DNS records for a domain
